Please see the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document.

## Getting started

Helpful notes for developers can be found in the [HACKING](HACKING.md)
document.

In addition to the above, if you use the presets file as instructed,
then you should NOT check it into source control, just as the CMake
documentation suggests.
